The official WordPress plugin, built by TABLE.

TABLE provides all-in-one, on-demand customer service in one seamless interface, connecting every customer channel and interaction.

== Description ==
[TABLE](https://table.co) provides an all-in-one, digital-first, seamless chat platform.

Delight your customers with tailored messages based on their needs, from scheduling appointments to processing payments and connecting with live agents. Your agents can interact with customers through voice and video calls, group messaging, screen and file sharing, and much more.

[TABLE](https://table.co) encourages co-shopping with colleagues, friends, and family members to help speed your customer’s decision process. Let them communicate with you exactly when, how, and where they want. Because TABLE keeps every channel and interaction in one unified platform, the customer never has to repeat themselves.

With quick and easy integration, TABLE can be launched from your website or app, social media posts, QR codes, emails, online ads—just about anywhere.

With its context-specific, media-rich features, TABLE allows any brand to strengthen customer relationships with experiences that make your brand memorable.

== Installation ==
Installing TABLE on your WordPress site takes just a few minutes.

You can find instructions on using the TABLE chat widget [here](https://docs.table.co/category/p7bth2efvv-live-chat-installation).

Once you've installed the plugin, you can optionally enable [Identity Verification](https://docs.table.co/article/4hyc4dkc8w-identity-verification). Your logged-in WordPress users will be tracked in TABLE as users, and visitors who aren’t logged in will be tracked as guests.

If you use the Identify Verification feature, we'll add a Javascript snippet when users are logged in, which contains dynamic user data (email, registration timestamp and if available, the users first name and last name). If you use caching, you\'ll need to exclude logged in customers. Need help with this? Contact us. 

Please note, this plugin loads a Javascript file (inappchat.js), which is required for the chat widget to work. This service is provided by [TABLE](https://table.co) and usage of it is governed by our [privacy policy](https://table.co/privacy/) and our [terms of service](https://table.co/terms/).
